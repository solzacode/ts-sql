# ts-xql

An SQL builder in Typescript. This project is heavily inspired by [XQL](/extjs/xql). A big shout out to @exjs and @kobalicek for this amazing project.

## Beta

This project is currently in a beta stage and will continue to be until most of the features are built out.

## Introduction

ts-sql is designed to build SQL programmatically and generate an AST. You can customize the AST programmatically. The AST will also support serialization to/from JSON. The AST can be compiled into a SQL query using query builders. Initially ts-sql will come with a MySQL builder. Other builders will be added as needed.

## Installation

```sh
npm install ts-sql --save
yarn add ts-sql
```

## Usage

TBD.
